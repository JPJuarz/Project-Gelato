# Project Gelato

This project was made with the intention of learning the importance and usage of classes and objects inside of programming languages such as C++. The intention
is to, by the end of the project, have 3 or more fully developed classes that can help solve the problem presented in the following paragraph.

## Context

Recently, a week old ice cream shop has been having trouble with deciding between their sizes, prices, as well as type of ice cream, for which they 
have generated class structures to be able to handle their changes to the menu in a better and more efficient fashion. Since they have just begun, they 
only have 3 available flavors of ice cream at the time with those being: Stracciatela, Hazelnut, and Vanilla. With the classes, they want to be able to adjust
the prices, sizes, and type of each ice cream available at any given time for sale to be able to see which variant of each of these types of attributes 
sells the best to customers.

## Functionality

This program will help the user (as if they were the business owners) set the different attributes (type, size, price, topping) of each of the flavors of the shop in order to help with decisions of how it is that they want to sell their product. The program will also calculate the amount of calories of the building of the ice cream making the creation of different variations easier when it comes to analyzing the product.
At the same time it will include a Menu, which will be altered by the classes, for customers to look at the different options of ice cream that can be ordered
